# Changing the Cesium Ellipsoid

- Change ellipsoid to mars radius
- Override mapwrappercesium functions to account for quirks in the fly to functionality in Cesium (note about how Cesium isn't super great with different ellipsoids, maybe link to github/forum issue, mention how terrain doesn't quite work with normal ellipsoid except when you set terrain exaggeration to not be exactly 1.., get weird holes...?)
- "clampToGround" option for Cesium labels
