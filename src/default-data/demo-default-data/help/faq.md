### How do I turn on a layer?

1. Open the **LAYER CONTROLS** in the upper right corner of the map.
2. Scroll down the list of available layers to the layer you wish to activate.
3. Click on the switch toggle just the left of the layer title.

### Why can't I see an active layer?

_Some possible options are:_

#### The layer does not have data for the selected day
Try switching to a date you are sure has data.

#### The layer is beneath other active layer with similar spatial coverage
Try using the **LAYER CONTROLS** to move this layer to the top

#### The layer does not have spatial coverage in your current view.
Try zooming out to view the entire globe.

##### NOTE: The **LAYER CONTROLS** will remain in alphabetical order

### How do I change the date?

* Option 1: Using the **date picker**
  * Use the buttons above/below the current year/month/day to increment the date
