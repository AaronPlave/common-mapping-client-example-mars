### The Common Mapping Client

The Common Mapping Client (CMC) aims to solve the problem of redundant and unshared code in scientific web mapping applications.  

Over the years, there have been many projects that try to solve the same issue: put data on a map and explore it. There is an increasingly steep hill to climb when it comes to deciding: Which framework should I start from? Which library will give me all the features I need? How to I glue all these together with a code layout that I won't want to burn next week? CMC solves this by bundling together a solid and modular base framework with an extensive mapping library, a well thought out component structure, and a thick shield against feature-creep to deliver you what is essentially a starter project for mapping that will let you start building the cool stuff faster.  

We maintain a list of further example projects and projects that began from CMC so that you can easily get examples of building intricate and detailed workflows on top of our client.
