    "description": "This data was acquired using the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft (MRO). MRO was launched on August 12, 2005 and arrived at Mars on March 10, 2006. It maintains a nearly circular orbit, completing an orbital revolution about every 112 minutes at an altitude of approximately 250 to 316 km or 155 to 196 miles. MRO carries a sophisticated suite of instruments used to analyze and map the landforms, stratigraphy, minerals, and ice of Mars. The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera utilizes a 0.5-meter telescope to obtain very high resolution images of Martian landforms and terrains. From an altitude of 300 km, HiRISE has a resolution of 0.3 meters per pixel. In addition to being used for getting very detailed images of surface features, pairs of slightly offset HiRISE images are combined to produce precise digital elevation models of Martian topography.",
