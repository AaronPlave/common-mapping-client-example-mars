	"title": "This global geologic map of Mars, which records the distribution of geologic units and landforms on the planet's surface through time, is based on unprecedented variety, quality, and quantity of remotely sensed data acquired since the Viking Orbiters. These data have provided morphologic, topographic, spectral, thermophysical, radar sounding, and other observations for integration, analysis, and interpretation in support of geologic mapping. In particular, the precise topographic mapping now available has enabled consistent morphologic portrayal of the surface for global mapping (whereas previously used visual-range image bases were less effective, because they combined morphologic and albedo information and, locally, atmospheric haze). Also, thermal infrared image bases used for this map tended to be less affected by atmospheric haze and thus are reliable for analysis of surface morphology and texture at even higher resolution than the topographic products.

    "description": "This product was assembled from data gathered using the Viking Orbiter Imaging Systems aboard the Viking 1 and Viking 2 orbiters. Identical vidicon cameras aboard both orbiters were equipped with 475-mm focal length telephoto lenses, yielding fields of view of 1.54° X 1.69°. From an orbital altitude of 1500 km, each frame covers a minimum area on the surface of 40 X 44 km. Six selectable filters allowed color images to be acquired.",
